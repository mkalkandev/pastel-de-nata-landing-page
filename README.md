This was my sixth project with HTML and CSS and I'm happy with the result. This time I tried to learn new things, so I tried to structure HTML better and used flex and grid in CSS and introduced CSS keyframes and pseudo element properties.

I plan to continue exploring and learning more about this technology, so there will definitely be more projects related to it soon.
